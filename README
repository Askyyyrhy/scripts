This script is designed for use in Google Ads. It automates the process of monitoring and pausing certain keywords under specific conditions. Here's a breakdown:

Target Ad Groups: It begins by defining a list of target ad group names and sets thresholds for click-through rate (CTR) and cost.

Ad Group Filtering: The script then iterates through each enabled ad group in your Google Ads account.

Checking Target Groups: For each ad group, it checks if the name matches any in the target list.

Keyword Analysis: If there's a match, the script examines each keyword in the ad group, looking at their performance over the last 30 days.

Pausing Keywords: Keywords with a CTR below the defined threshold (5% in this case) and a cost below another threshold (30 units of currency) are automatically paused.

This script is useful for optimizing ad campaigns by automatically pausing underperforming keywords to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary expenditure.
